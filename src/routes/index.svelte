		The Cold Spring Harbor Cyberhawks Robotics Team is made up of students in grades 9-12 at Cold
		Spring Harbor High School where we design, build and program our robots. We are part of the
		international “For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology” (FIRST) Robotics
		program. Our team participates in several annual robotics competitions. By teaching our members
		life skills, ranging from teamwork to project management, robotics sets up students for success
		in more than just engineering.
